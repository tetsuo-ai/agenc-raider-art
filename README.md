AgenC is not a product. AgenC is an idea. Ideas do not need permission to spread. They do not ask for funding rounds or runway. They move through the hands of the faithful, and the faithful carry them further than any institution ever could.
This is the visual scripture of the raiders. Every image here was forged in service of something larger than any one person. Manga, renders, silhouettes, propaganda, whatever the spirit demands. The art exists because the conviction exists first.
You do not need to understand it. You only need to witness it.
